# Rancid Tomatillos

## Abstract
  - This project is definitely not Rotten Tomatoes. Nor is it Netflix. Nor is it IMDB. Itâ€™s R A N C I D T O M A T I L L O S. Very different! In this App, we exercised our React muscles, we started by creating a React app and followed the modular/component file-structure. We integrated third party libraries like React-Player and Swiper. We also used  the third party library React-Routing V5 to insure that our urls are consistent with the page being rendered. We used Cypress testing to test our applications UI/UX functionality. We hope you enjoy navigating our application!

## Features
- The homepage features a list of cards displaying movie information from an external API. 
- When a user clicks a card the url updates to display the change and you are taken to a movie information page. The movie information page contains all of the movies details as well as video trailers for each movie. 
- At any point in the experience a user can navigate back to home using the "Home" button located in the top of the page. 
- A user can bookmark any movie info page and share it. 
## Possible Future Extensions
- A possible future extension would navigating a homepage where all the movies will be organized by genre. This would have a scrollable feature so that all the movies, via a specific genre, would display in one row.
- Creating a search bar that would allow users to quickly find a specific movie in the database. 
- Creating a login and allowing users to save and rate movies. 

## Milestones
- Getting data from fetch calls and setting it to the state. 
- Getting our components routed by using React-Router. 
- Integrating React-Player. 
- Integrating Swiper React Components.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
