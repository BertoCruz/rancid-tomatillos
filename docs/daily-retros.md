# Daily Retros


## Thursday 10/13/22
- Today we created:
    - File structures
    - iteration 1 requirements
    - Completed day 2 deliverables, and submitted these to Leta and Scott.


### Challenges:
- Hunter: organization, but once we figured out the file organization it became much clearer.
- Dani: My understanding of how our actual HTML elements should be organized in React. Also, understanding how styling in CSS differs from vanilla JS -the fact that we're creating different CSS files.

### Wins
- Hunter: Figuring out the data flow; understanding the component architectural flow. 

- Dani: Getting a better understanding on the component architectural flow, as well.


## Friday 10/14/22
- Today we created:
    - rendering part of our movie details layout
    - along with styling


### Challenges:
- Hunter: CSS styling the movie details.
- Dani: trying to figure out our component architecture for the movie details view, specifically trying to figure out whether this component should be a class component or functional component. Another thing, trying to figure out where our fetch calls for our movie details could live in; whether up in `App.js` or down with `MovieInfo.js`

### Wins
- Hunter: We made the `MovieInfo` component along with the CSS!

- Dani: Knocking out the `MovieInfo` component and CSS along with it.




## Saturday 10/15/22
- Today we created:
    - finished our fetch calls for rendering all movies to display
    - our fetch calls for rendering a single movie's details
    - We got our pop up to display 
    
- To Do:
    - We still need to position our movie details pop up over all of the movies
    - we still need to create a close pop up feature as well. 


### Challenges:
- Hunter: The entire process behind getting the ID from the `Card.js` we are clicking on to go onto our fetch call found in `App.js`. Also figuring out hooks. understanding conditional rendering.
- Dani: Challenge was figuring out how to pass along the id of the `Card` component, but it was also coming to the solution of using ES6 arrow functions to access our "this.state". Another thing was trying to figure out how to use hooks to display our pop up feature, which we didn't use in the end, but could perhaps implement it in the future.

### Wins
- Hunter: Getting the data into our pop up!

- Dani: Understanding the flow of prop process - data down and action up. Also, getting our individual movie data to render on the pop up component. Another was getting to witness our fetch calls working properly!
