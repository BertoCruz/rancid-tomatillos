# Daily Retros


## Thursday 10/13/22
- Today we created:
    - File structures
    - iteration 1 requirements
    - Completed day 2 deliverables, and submitted these to Leta and Scott.


### Challenges:
- Hunter: organization, but once we figured out the file organization it became much clearer.
- Dani: My understanding of how our actual HTML elements should be organized in React. Also, understanding how styling in CSS differs from vanilla JS -the fact that we're creating different CSS files.

### Wins
- Hunter: Figuring out the data flow; understanding the component architectural flow. 

- Dani: Getting a better understanding on the component architectural flow, as well.


## Friday 10/14/22
- Today we created:
    - rendering part of our movie details layout
    - along with styling


### Challenges:
- Hunter: CSS styling the movie details.
- Dani: trying to figure out our component architecture for the movie details view, specifically trying to figure out whether this component should be a class component or functional component. Another thing, trying to figure out where our fetch calls for our movie details could live in; whether up in `App.js` or down with `MovieInfo.js`

### Wins
- Hunter: We made the `MovieInfo` component along with the CSS!

- Dani: Knocking out the `MovieInfo` component and CSS along with it.
